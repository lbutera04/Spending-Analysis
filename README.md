# Spending Analysis

This is my template for analyzing my spending year-over-year. It is a relatively simple process, with a few cool algorithms I used to detect things like recurring purchases (i.e. subscriptions), and other patterns in spending data.

I will include a couple different iterations of this project in this repo.
